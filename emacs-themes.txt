1. The Ellas Theme
2. The Somnus Theme
3. Monokate theme


This page contains a collection of Emacs themes that I've developed or
ported from other editors (specifically Monokate, see below).

I have a very straightforward approach to making themes: I start with
nothing and build up, I use my themes while coding or writing and what
irritates me, I fix. The source code of the themes I present below is
very simple to comprehend and, if you want to modify or use any of my
themes as a template, you can easily do so.

I have to say that none of my themes have any kind of versioning: they
are taken directly from what I use for my Emacs. If you want to get the
latest version, use the links to the Emacs Lisp file for each theme to
do so -- I intend to make those URLs static, so you can fetch them
periodically.

If, for any reason, you have a question or suggestion, you can [contact
me through email].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may want to have available on your system all of my themes, but
they're not in any official package repository like Melpa. You can
obtain all of my Emacs themes through this command:

,----
| export EMACS_THEMES_DIR=$HOME/.emacs.d/ && curl -s https://gligan.net/emacs-themes.sh | sh
`----

If you have your Emacs themes in a different folder, change
`EMACS_THEMES_DIR' accordingly -- you should know what you're doing if
you have a custom themes folder.

1 The Ellas Theme
=================

  <https://gligan.net/ellas.png>

  [`https://gligan.net/ellas-theme.el']

  Ellas is a charming, light, having somewhat of a pastel palette, theme
  with colours inspired by a trip I made to Greece.

  This is the first theme I have made from scratch. My eye says that the
  contrast of Ellas is enough --not great-- but very usable and not
  eye-straining, which is one of my main concerns; I hate when pure
  `#000000' black fights directly with `#ffffff' white. I think I have
  done a god job. Still, you are not me. If you think I should improve
  some part of this theme, plase let me know.

2 The Somnus Theme
==================

  <https://gligan.net/somnus.png>

  [`https://gligan.net/somnus-theme.el']

  Somnus is a calming blue and yellow theme inspired on the idea of
  sleep, of being comfortable. It has more contrast than Monokate,
  though.

  This is my main dark theme. I made it so I have a pair of light and
  dark themes; namely Ellas and Somnus.

3 Monokate theme
================

  <https://gligan.net/monokate.png>

  [`https://gligan.net/monokate-theme.el']

  Long ago I used Sublime Text as my main code editor -- it is still a
  pretty good program; but, shamefully, it is proprietary software, and
  that is not in keeping with my ideals. At that time I discovered a
  "repository" of themes called [Colorsublime], which I thought and
  still think has a great selection of themes. The one I used was
  [Monokate]. When I finally switched to Emacs I was in need of a theme
  like Monokate. Fortunately, I didn't found any, so I wrote this port.

  Please note that this port I've made is not a 100% replica of
  Colorsublime's Monokate because I felt the need to add more colors to
  make the theme more complete. However, I believe that the /vibes/ of
  the original Monokate are kept with this port.
